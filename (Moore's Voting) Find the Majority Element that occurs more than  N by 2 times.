N = 5 
A[] = {3,1,3,3,2} 
Output:
3
Explanation:
Since, 3 is present more
than N/2 times, so it is 
the majority element.

Brute Force Approach - 
We will run a loop that will select the elements of the array one by one.
Now, for each element, we will run another loop and count its occurrence in the given array.
If any element occurs more than the floor of (N/2), we will simply return it.

class Solution
{
    static int majorityElement(int a[], int size)
    {
        // your code here
        int n=size/2;
        int start=0;
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0; i<size; i++){
            int count=0;
            for(int j=0; j<size; j++){
                if(a[i]==a[j]){
                    count++;
                }
                if(count>n) return a[i];
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}

** Better Approach -- Using hashmap (Refer Internet)

Optimized approach --
Optimal Approach: Moore’s Voting Algorithm:
Intuition:
If the array contains a majority element, its occurrence must be greater than the floor(N/2). Now, we can say that the count of minority elements and majority elements is equal up to a certain point in the array. So when we traverse through the array we try to keep track of the count of elements and the element itself for which we are tracking the count. 

After traversing the whole array, we will check the element stored in the variable. If the question states that the array must contain a majority element, the stored element will be that one but if the question does not state so, then we need to check if the stored element is the majority element or not. If not, then the array does not contain any majority element.

Approach: 
Initialize 2 variables:
Count –  for tracking the count of element
Element – for which element we are counting
Traverse through the given array.
If Count is 0 then store the current element of the array as Element.
If the current element and Element are the same increase the Count by 1.
If they are different decrease the Count by 1.
The integer present in Element should be the result we are expecting .

Code --

class Solution
{
    static int majorityElement(int a[], int size)
    {
        // your code here
        int n=size/2;
        int count=0;
        int ele=0;
        for(int i=0; i<size; i++){
            if(count==0){
                count=1;
                ele=a[i];
            }
            else if(a[i]==ele) count++;
            else count--;
        }
        int count2=0;
        for(int i=0; i<size; i++){
            if(a[i]==ele) count2++;
        }
        if(count2>n) return ele;
        else return -1;
    }
}
