// The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. 
//This process is repeated for the remaining unsorted portion until the entire list is sorted.
// Here we take pos where we store the element of ith position and compare with running loop of j and if found smallest then place it at ith position as i is is the first loop and  is on starting position
// and it continues until array is sorted. 
// j loops starts from i+1 because till i it is already sorted
