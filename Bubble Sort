Bubble Sort-- Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. 
Complexity- O(n^2)
In Bubble Sort algorithm, 

Traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. 
In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. 
This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.

i stands for the current pass
We are using i here because element til i pass are already sorted. Like after first iteration completed for i=0, last element is already sorted so there is no need to go till last element.

for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
	for(int j=0; j<n-i-1; j++){
		if(arr[j+1]<arr[j]){
			int temp=arr[j];
			arr[j]=arr[j+1];
			arr[j+1]=temp;
		}
	}
}
